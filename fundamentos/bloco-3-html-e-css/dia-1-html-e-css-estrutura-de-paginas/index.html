    <p>Hey guys, my name is Pedro Alves, I have 28 years old and live in Recife - Pernambuco. I`m a entrepreneur that stopped the routine to breath technology with trybe.<br>
    and will become a Full Stack developer soon! </p>
    <p>I`ve started to have interest in coding and technology a few years ago, my history did not involve technology at all, only in leasure time with games and geek stuffs.<br>
    Since I`ve made 15 years old, I wanted to have my own company, to have the responsability and obligations with employes and routine however, after 8 years <br> 
    I really want to try something that would be more challenging than selling soap and broom.<br>
    I`m really thankfull for what my company gave and taught me, but the technology world is really interesting and give you the chance to work anywhere to anyone! </p>

        <p>Our name is Paco, Don and Apollo, respectively!</p>
        <p>We are brothers, however, Apollo has a poodle as father, thats why he is a little bit different from us</p>
        <p>Don is the biggest one, Paco the lovilier and lazy, Apollo is the craziest one, for sure</p>
